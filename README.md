# project-lunAres

This project is an AI-enhanced accessibility testing framework for the RMIT website. It uses Playwright and axe-core to perform multi-page, multi-flow accessibility audits while integrating a local LLM (via Ollama with Mistral:7B-Instruct) for contextual analysis and remediation suggestions.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
