       - .footerCol:nth-child(4) > .desktop__footerlinks
       - .footerCol:nth-child(5) > .desktop__footerlinks
       - a[data-analytics-value="Study with Us"]
       - a[href$="life-at-rmit"][data-analytics-value="Life at RMIT"][data-analytics-type="footerlink"]
       - a[href$="research"][data-analytics-value="Research"][data-analytics-type="footerlink"]

       - a[data-analytics-value="About"][href$="about"][data-analytics-type="footerlink"]
     - Additionally, the parent container of the above elements, '#accordion' role='tablist'.

  3. User-Centric Explanation:
     - Screen reader users might not be able to navigate through these impacted elements, causing confusion and navigation difficulties as they try to access content or perform actions on the Homepage.

  4. User Story/Business Impact:
     - When a screen reader user tries to explore the Homepage footer links, the lack of appropriate children roles for the ARIA-required roles causes confusion, making it difficult for them to navigate and find the desired content or perform actions, leading to potential frustration and abandonment.

  5. WCAG Reference:
     - The violation tags indicate that this issue aligns with the following guidelines under WCAG 2.2: cat.aria, wcag2a, wcag131, EN-301-549, EN-9.1.3.1

  6. Remediation:
     - Ensure that any ARIA roles (in this case, listbox or treeitem) have the required child roles specified according to their respective semantics. For example, a listbox should contain option elements as children.
       - In this case, it is likely that a listbox role is being used on the unordered lists (ul). To address this issue, consider replacing these ul tags with ol or nav tags and use the appropriate aria-role and child roles to maintain accessibility compliance.

===== Aggregated Insights =====
------------------------
  Overall Statistics:
  - Total number of critical violations across pages: 6 (5 for aria-required-children and 1 for invalid aria-roles)
  - Total number of serious violations across pages: 2 (tabindex)

  Common Patterns:
  - ARIA issues related to the lack of required child roles in various elements, specifically unordered lists (ul) and anchor tags (a).
  - Misuse or missing tabindex values causing unexpected focus order.

  Cross-page Insights:
  - Footer sections across multiple pages contain similar issues with ARIA roles not having the correct child roles. It is recommended to review footer structure consistency for accessibility compliance.
  - Tabindex attribute misuse or missing values are found throughout various pages, emphasizing the need to strictly adhere to tabindex best practices across the site.
  - Skipping links have inconsistencies in tabindex usage across pages, so it is essential to standardize their handling for better keyboard navigation.

  - Address critical ARIA violations first (impacting screen reader users) by ensuring proper children roles for elements with defined ARIA roles and validating the use of ARIA roles throughout the site.
  - Secondly, focus on fixing issues related to tabindex to ensure keyboard navigation is consistent and predictable for all users.
  - Additionally, make necessary updates to skip links to ensure they do not impact screen reader navigation or keyboard interaction.
